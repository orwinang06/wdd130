            <h3  id="sum3">Summary</h3>
            <p id="sum_para3">Bree Camden, ex-ballerina, caring ballet teacher, and best friends with Nathan Donelson. Nathan Donelson, NFL star quarterback and Bree’s best friend. Are they really best friends though? Both secretly crushing since they became friends in high school and still loved each other the years they weren’t in contact, but can they make it out of the friend zone? They have the perfect opportunity after a clip goes viral leading to them fake dating. Will they realized each others real feelings and make their way to the end zone and into a relationship?</p>
            <h3 id="rev3">Review</h3>
            <p id="rev3_para">I think this book is hilarious. It reads like a funny, goofy, and embarrassing rom-com. It can be kind of predictable like a hallmark movie or rom-com too, but I find it to be a fun read, that you don’t have to think to hard about. The body the characters have and their bond with Nathan’s teammates. I think that relationship was hilarious to read about. The pinning and secret crushes and ways they show they care and support each other is an element is a cute fun part of the story too. If you hate second hand embarrassment than this might not be the right book for you, but if you’re in the mood for a cheesy, easy read, rom-com, then this might be what you’re looking for.</p>
            <h3 id="rate3">Age Rating:16+</h3>
            <p id="rate3para">All of the characters are adults in this book, post college and living their lives. While there are no explicit scenes, there is some discussion and scenes with drinking. The romance plot as is also in my opinion better suited for older, more mature teens and adults. It reads like a fun and embarrassing romance movie.</p>
