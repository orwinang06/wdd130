            <p>Hi, I’m Angelina Orwin! While I may be no author, I’m an avid reader and have been for years. I’m a college student right now, and currently a freshman. I grew up constantly having a high reading level, but the books at those reading levels weren’t always right content wise and there weren’t sites for my parents to easily check and find appropriate books for me, especially with how I devoured the books. Now, I’m on the book sides of social media and it can be hard do find which books are the right fit. I also don’t love the rating style, with starts or 1-10, so here it’s just going to have my written out thoughts in the reviews. I hope you enjoy, and maybe find something new to pick up! Nice to meet you and enjoy your time here on My Shelf! </p>
