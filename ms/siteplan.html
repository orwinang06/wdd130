        About Me:
        Hi, I’m Angelina Orwin. While I may be no author, I’m an avid reader and have been for years. I’m a college student right now, and currently a freshman. I grew up constantly having a high reading level, but the books at those reading levels weren’t always right content wise and there weren’t sites for my parents to easily check and find appropriate books for me, especially with how I devoured the books. Now, I’m on the book sides of social media and it can be hard do find which books are the right fit. I also don’t love the rating style, with starts or 1-10, so here it’s just going to have my written out thoughts in the reviews. I hope you enjoy, and maybe find something new to pick up! Nice to meet you and enjoy your time here on My Shelf!

        Royal Target by Traci Hunter Abrams
Age Rating: 15-16+
Explanation: I would say this book is better fit for older teenagers as firstly the main characters are both adults post college education. This book is clean as there is no swearing or dirty scenes, so if could be shared with a little more youthful audience. However, part of the plot deals with conversion to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, how non-member family may handle it and CIA work including bombs, threats, death threats, weapons, secret keeping, and lying. Those topics may be better suited for readers closer to 15 or 16 would could better handle both of those topics and adventure.
Summary:  Janessa Rogers is a CIA agent. AS the us is building an embassy in the small country of Meridia. When she is called to help and meet the royal family, she is expecting to use her acquired skills and protect, not play fake fiancée to the second born Prince of the country, Garret Fortier. Neither expect to fall in love during this fake proposal, it was supposed to be extra security and someone on the inside. How can they deal with threats, society and social pressure, their faith, their families, their professional lives, and placing their loyalty as they fall in love.
Review: I personally really liked this book. I think the action and adventure is fun and exciting. I know not everyone would feel the same way as religion, specifically the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints does play an important role in the book and both of the main characters are members of their faith with Janessa being a member for longer and Garret being converted and baptized while he attended college outside of his home country of Meridia. I feel that they do portray the religion pretty well, but that if someone is really sensitive about religion and wouldn’t like it to be a key part of the book, then this book may not be the right book for that person. It can be cheese and predictable at times, but I can enjoy that and have fun with it, and it has a few twists. This isn’t really a think and ponder deeply book, but rather for me, it is a fun and easy read.
You can fnd this book at locations such as Desseret Book, Seagull Book, and Amazon.

        The Cruel Prince by Holly Black
Age Rating: 13+
Explanation: This book can at times be rather violent. They live in a land where people often seek power. Madoc is a redcap, who can be violent and blood-seeking creatures. There is a joke that all the Holly Black girls have to had trauma and a rough life, and the Duarte sisters definitely have this. It can be a fun book if you like a different plot with a romance subplot. I feel like the main plot is more of that of the politics of this Faerie land and can remind me of the dystopian novels many also read and enjoy around 13 and this level. Specifically in terms of the violence and content of the first book I feel like it can be similar to the Divergent and The Maze Runner books.
Summary: Living in Faerie is never easy, especially not as a human. Jude Duarte began her life in this magical land at age 7 after the tragic death of her parents. She is raised aside her twin sister Taryn, older sister Viviene, and younger brother Oak. Raise by her older sister’s father, a redcap named Madoc, she has mastered and learned to fight. She seeks to find her way and her own place in Faerie, despite the way she is treated as a human. She must defy those around her to seek what she desires and find her place. She must use careful strategy to survive and come out of this adventure alive and on top, even if it means dealing with her enemies, those who mocked and hurt her.
Review: I personally really loved and enjoyed this book. I loved seeing the way different characters handled problems, even the same problem. I think the main plot, of kind of this political agenda and warfare that emerges with other challenges makes it a really fun book to sit and enjoy. The romance plot is underneath the rest of the plot and really develops over this book and the next two in the series. This is the first book of  a three-book series so you’re in for an adventure. There are also a few connected books like a duology set several years later with some of the other side characters years later. There is also a book on one of the side characters called “How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories” that can be read after this series. I personally feel like this first book doesn’t end on a cliff hanger which is nice. If you want a fun adventure and to be able to think through an interesting plot of secrets, lies and deception, on a less intense than a major thriller or mystery level, then this might be a great book for you.

      The Cheat Sheet by Sarah Adams
Age Rating: 16+
Explanation: All of the characters are adults in this book, post college and living their lives. While there are no explicit scenes, there is some discussion and scenes with drinking. The romance plot as is also in my opinion better suited for older, more mature teens and adults. It reads like a fun and embarrassing romance movie.
Summary: Bree Camden, ex-ballerina, caring ballet teacher, and best friends with Nathan Donelson. Nathan Donelson, NFL star quarterback and Bree’s best friend. Are they really best friends though? Both secretly crushing since they became friends in high school and still loved each other the years they weren’t in contact, but can they make it out of the friend zone? They have the perfect opportunity after a clip goes viral leading to them fake dating. Will they realized each others real feelings and make their way to the end zone and into a relationship?
Review: I think this book is hilarious. It reads like a funny, goofy, and embarrassing rom-com. It can be kind of predictable like a hallmark movie or rom-com too, but I find it to be a fun read, that you don’t have to think to hard about. The body the characters have and their bond with Nathan’s teammates. I think that relationship was hilarious to read about. The pinning and secret crushes and ways they show they care and support each other is an element is a cute fun part of the story too. If you hate second hand embarrassment than this might not be the right book for you, but if you’re in the mood for a cheesy, easy read, rom-com, then this might be what you’re looking for.
Tags: Cute Romance, Fake Dating, Best Friends You can find this book at stores like Barnes and Noble or Amazon. This may also be avaible at local book stores near you too.
